# Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin (AAB)

This is a plugin for TiddlyWiki which contains templates that assist the creation of a library data encyclopedia for use with the Traveller roleplaying game.

TiddlyWiki is an open source wiki that stores an entire wiki in a single HTML file and requires no other software apart from a modern web browser. It works well for both online and offline use.

The plugin includes specific templates for the rendering of:

* System details
* System map hexes
* Subsector maps
* Sector maps at subsector level

The data for these templates is stored as tiddler fields, thus allowing the separation of structured data from the unstructured text in the library data entries.
